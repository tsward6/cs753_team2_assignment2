Programming Assignment2


This currently runs Part 1 and 2 of programming assignment 2.

I am a tad unclear as to what is required for step 2, but the framework seems logical.

Parts 1 and 2 require no user input, so a bash script is provided that does all of the work. 

in a linux terminal, cd to wherever the folder was extracted and enter the following command:
  bash part2.sh
  
This script runs the following commands:
  1) maven compile command
  2) run the jar file maven created (team2_1-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
  3) run the python script that uses pytrec_eval to get results for part 2 (part2.py)
